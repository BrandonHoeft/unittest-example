# Learning the unittest library in Python

This repo exists for me to learn how to use the `unittest` module in the
Python standard library for testing the functionality of my code.

The code being tested is a simple function called longest_word(sentence),
which has the following characteristics:

* returns the longest word in a sentence string.
* if > 1 word has same longest length, return the first word.
* ignore punctuation
